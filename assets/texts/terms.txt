See telegram.org/tos (Telegram Terms of Service). __Violation of these rules can lead to a permanent ban of your account for this chatbot and for all upcoming chatbots. And if you haven't received messages from the bot for hours, make sure you haven't stopped it, otherwise you may have been blacklisted for a rule violation.__

**How to use the chatbot and how it works?**

This chatbot works in a similar way to a normal group, the main difference is that everything is private and anonymous; in this way your personal information will not be compromised. The bot copies the content of the messages you send it, then distributes them to other members using the bot's own name and data, thus ensuring that your information is not linked to those messages and what you send to the bot is only between you and the bot.

**What is a command and how to use them?**

A command is a special message that allows you to interact directly with a bot. Commands are prepended with the symbol / followed by the command name in lowercase and without whitespaces.

You can use the commands by sending them directly to the bot or by clicking on the link in the command. 

When you send a command to a bot, only you will receive the response to that command, it will not be visible to others.
